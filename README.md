# Ongoing DSA C++ Questions Repository

Welcome to the Ongoing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) C++ Questions Repository! This repository is a dynamic collection of DSA practice questions implemented in C++. It's designed to provide a continuous source of DSA challenges for improving your algorithmic problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews.

## Introduction

This repository is an ever-growing resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts using C++. New questions are regularly added to cover a wide range of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. Each question comes with a C++ solution to help you understand how to approach and implement solutions effectively.

## Topics Covered

The repository currently covers a variety of DSA topics, and we're continuously expanding our coverage. Some of the topics included are:

- Array Manipulation
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- and more...

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone github.com/SehajMander/dsa_with_cpp
   ```

2. **Explore Questions**: Browse through the repository to find DSA practice questions organized by topics.

3. **Choose a Question**: Select a question you want to solve and open its corresponding C++ solution file.

4. **Implement Your Solution**: Implement your solution to the selected question in C++.

5. **Test Your Solution**: Test your solution with sample inputs and verify its correctness.

6. **Repeat**: Practice solving more questions from different topics to enhance your DSA skills.
